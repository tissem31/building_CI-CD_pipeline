# Flask Sklearn CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Flask-based machine learning web application using CI/CD pipelines.
We first test and automate using GitHub Actions, then deploy and extend the automation using Azure DevOps Pipelines.

# Overview

This is a machine learning project built with Flask and Scikit-Learn. The purpose is to automate testing and deployment using CI/CD practices.

   - The application predicts housing prices using a linear regression model.

   - The CI/CD flow includes:

        - Linting, testing, and packaging the application using make and pytest.

        - GitHub Actions to run these tests automatically.

        - Azure Pipelines for automated deployment to Azure App Service.

        - Final result: A web app with a /predict endpoint that returns a prediction based on input features.

* GitHub Actions CI Badge
Ensure the README.md contains your Actions badge:

[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/tissem31/building_CI-CD_pipeline/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tissem31/building_CI-CD_pipeline/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)


## Enhancements

* Add more tests to make sure everything works well.
* Docker Support: Containerize the app using Docker for better portability and scalability, and deploy it using Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service.
* Pipeline Optimization: Improve CI/CD pipeline performance by caching dependencies and running jobs in parallel where possible.
